Bootable USB Maker

Dragon's Boot is a PC Diagnosics USB Kit, and this program is meant to take any removable media storage and format it
in orded to make it bootable. It has a GUI that blends together the formatting tool (fbinst), a vitual machine for
testing the USB (QEMU) and a menu editor for configuring the menu.lst files the user can add, remove or modify. Planned
but not in the scope of this hackathon is the ability to burn the USB with an image of a MasterUSB.

TL;DR:
- Format any Storage Device and make it bootable
- Test any Bootable Device in a Virtual Machine
- GUI enabled Menu editing for GRUB4DOS
