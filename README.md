Bootable USB Maker

Dragon's Boot is a PC Diagnosics USB Kit, and this program is meant to take any removable media storage and format it
in order to make it bootable. It has a GUI that blends together the formatting tool (fbinst), a vitual machine for
testing the USB (QEMU). Planned but not in the scope of this hackathon is the ability to burn the USB with an image of a MasterUSB.

TL;DR:
- Format any Storage Device and make it bootable
- Test any Bootable Device in a Virtual Machine
- GUI enabled Menu editing for GRUB4DOS
